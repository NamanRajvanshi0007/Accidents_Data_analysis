📌 Project Title

Time Series Analysis of Nashville Accident Injuries (2018–2025)

📖 Overview

This project analyzes historical accident data from Nashville (Jan 2018 – Apr 2025), focusing on the Number of Injuries reported per day.
It applies time series analysis techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and seasonality, and builds forecasting models to predict future injury counts.

🎯 Objectives

Explore patterns and trends in accident injuries over time.

Detect seasonality and cyclic behavior.

Test stationarity using ADF and KPSS.

Build and evaluate ARIMA-based forecasting models.

Visualize data insights with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, statsmodels, scikit-learn, scipy

Statistical Methods: ADF test, KPSS test, Yule-Walker equations, Hodrick–Prescott filter

Models Used: AutoRegressive (AR), ARIMA

Evaluation Metrics: MAE, RMSE
